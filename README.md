# Pipboy-Project-HTML-CSS-JS-
my attempt at replicating the pipboy app form fallout 4 as practice for HTML CSS JS and Bootstrap.

Fallout has been one of my top favourite video games and pipboy is a tiny wrist bounded equipment with a small screen which shows your health status and all your charachter details.
This is my attempt at replicating that UI using HTML CSS and JS.

Points to notice:
1.The retro-look given using alternating light and dark lines
2.The images were all edited during runtime using CSS
3.The unique navbar active element style given.
4.On INV page, the values are being updated as you hover over the weapons names.
5.You can navigate between STAT and INV bar only as of now.

An image of pipboy has been provided in the repository for your reference.

Thank you.
